// Here we will learn everything about variables in JavaScript

/*
 * Variable:
 * A variable is a named memory location used to store data.
 * We can declare variables using var, let, and const in JavaScript.
 */

/*
 * Difference between var, let, and const:
 *
 * 1. Scope:
 *    - var ‚Üí function scope
 *    - let and const ‚Üí block scope (within {}, like in if, for, etc.)
 *
 * 2. Hoisting:
 *    - var is hoisted and initialized with undefined
 *    - let and const are hoisted but not initialized ‚Üí accessing them before declaration gives a ReferenceError (TDZ: Temporal Dead Zone)
 *
 * 3. Re-declaration:
 *    - var ‚Üí allowed
 *    - let and const ‚Üí not allowed in the same scope
 *
 * 4. Re-initialization (Re-assignment):
 *    - var and let ‚Üí allowed
 *    - const ‚Üí not allowed (value must be assigned only once)
 *
 * 5. Global Scope Behavior:
 *    - a var variable also becomes a property of the global object (window in browsers)
 *    - let and const do not attach themselves to the global object
 */

/* 
 * Scope in JavaScript
 * JavaScript has three types of scopes:

 * 1. Global Scope:
 *    - Variables declared outside any function or block.
 *    - Accessible throughout the entire program.
 *    - In browsers, global variables declared with var also become properties of the window object.

 * 2. Function Scope:
 *    - Variables declared with var inside a function.
 *    - Accessible only within that function.
 *    - let and const also follow function scope when declared inside a function.

 * 3. Block Scope:
 *    - Variables declared with let and const inside a block (e.g., if, for, while, etc.)
 *    - Accessible only within that specific block.
 *    - var does NOT have block scope‚Äîit leaks outside the block.

 */

/*
 * Hoisting in JavaScript:
 *
 * Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations
 * (not initializations) to the top of their scope (global or function).
 *
 * Both var, let, const, and functions are hoisted.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * - var is hoisted and initialized with undefined.
 * - let and const are hoisted but not initialized ‚Äî accessing them before declaration causes ReferenceError (TDZ).
 * - Function declarations are fully hoisted (both name and body).
 * - Function expressions and arrow functions behave like variables.
 */

// Example:
console.log(a); // undefined (hoisted var)
var a = 10;

// console.log(b); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
// let b = 20;

// console.log(c); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
// const c = 30;

sayHi(); // ‚úÖ works (function hoisted fully)
function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

// greet(); ‚ùå TypeError
const greet = function () {
  console.log("Hi there");
};

/*
 * Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ):
 *
 * TDZ is the time between entering the scope and the actual declaration
 * of a variable (with let or const), during which the variable cannot be accessed.
 *
 * Accessing the variable in this "zone" results in a ReferenceError.
 *
 * TDZ exists only for let and const, not for var.
 *
 * Why TDZ Exists:
 * - It helps catch programming errors early.
 * - Prevents access to variables before their intended initialization.
 */

// Example:
{
  // TDZ starts here for 'x'
  // console.log(x); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
  let x = 5; // TDZ ends here

  // ‚úÖ Now safe to access x
  console.log(x); // 5
}

{
  // TDZ for const 'y'
  // console.log(y); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
  const y = 10;
  console.log(y); // ‚úÖ 10
}

//   Example 1: var vs let in a loop

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}
// Output: 3 3 3

for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 100);
}
// Output: 0 1 2

/*---
üìå Why?

var is function-scoped, so all callbacks share the same i.

let is block-scoped, so each iteration gets a new j

---*/

// Example 2: Hoisting with var
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;

// Example 3: Hoisting with let
// console.log(y); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
// let y = 10;

3. What is the Temporal Dead Zone?

4. Why does var behave differently in loops?

5. Is const completely immutable?

/*
 * Scope Chaining in JavaScript:
 *
 * Scope chaining is the process by which JavaScript resolves variable names
 * in nested functions or blocks by looking outward from the current scope
 * to the outer (parent) scopes until it finds the variable.
 *
 * This chain of lexical environments forms the "scope chain".
 *
 * If a variable is not found in the current scope,
 * JavaScript looks into its parent scope, then grandparent, and so on,
 * up to the global scope. If not found, it throws a ReferenceError.
 *
 * Important:
 * - JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, meaning the scope chain is determined by
 *   where functions are written in the code, not where they are called.
 */

// Example:

let globalVar = "global";

function outer() {
  let functionVar = "outer";

  function inner() {
    let InnerVar = "inner";
    console.log(globalVar); // ‚úÖ looks in inner ‚Üí outer ‚Üí global ‚Üí found "global"
    console.log(functionVar); // ‚úÖ looks in inner ‚Üí outer ‚Üí found "outer"
    console.log(InnerVar); // ‚úÖ found in inner scope
  }

  inner();
}

outer();

// Trying to access b or c outside their scope:
// console.log(b); ‚ùå ReferenceError
// console.log(c); ‚ùå ReferenceError

/*---
üîó How the Scope Chain Works:
When console.log(a) is executed inside inner():

JS looks for a in inner() ‚Üí not found

Then checks outer() ‚Üí not found

Then checks global scope ‚Üí ‚úÖ found
