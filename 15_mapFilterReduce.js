 Differences between map, filter and reduce

 Okay so the main difference between map, filter, reduce is that
 map returns a new array after transforming each element as per the callback condition
 filter function filter out only those elements from an array those are passing the given callback condition
 reduce returns a single value ie accumulator after having some operation on each element of the given array, for example sum of every array element

 map returns a new array
 filter returns a new array
 reduce returns a single accumulator value
