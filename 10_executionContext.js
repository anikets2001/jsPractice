‚úÖ 1. What is Execution Context?
Execution Context is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

There are three types of execution contexts:

1. Global Execution Context (GEC)

2. Function Execution Context (FEC)

3. Eval Execution Context (rarely used)

---*/

/*---
‚úÖ 2. Creation Phase vs Execution Phase
Whenever a script or function runs, two phases occur inside the execution context:

Phase	What Happens
Creation Phase	Memory is allocated; variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized as undefined, let/const enter the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)`. Functions are hoisted fully.
Execution Phase	Code runs line-by-line and variables get actual values.

---*/
// ‚úÖ Example:
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;

/*---
var a is hoisted and initialized as undefined in the creation phase

a = 10 is assigned during the execution phase
---*/

/*---
‚úÖ 3. Lexical Environment
Lexical Environment is the place where variables/functions are physically written in the code (scope structure).

It consists of:

The current scope (variables, functions)

A reference to its outer lexical environment

---*/

// ‚úÖ Example:

function outer() {
  let a = 10;

  function inner() {
    console.log(a); // 10 ‚Üê looks in outer lexical environment
  }

  inner();
}
outer();

//   inner function closes over a, because it‚Äôs lexically inside outer.

/*---
‚úÖ 4. Scope Chain
Scope Chain is how JavaScript resolves variable names in nested functions.

When a variable is not found in the current scope:

JS moves to the outer lexical environment

It continues until it reaches the global scope

---*/

// ‚úÖ Visual Example:
let a = "global";

function outer() {
  let b = "outer";

  function inner() {
    let c = "inner";
    console.log(a, b, c);
  }

  inner();
}
outer(); // output: "global outer inner"

// scope chain
// inner() ‚Üí outer() ‚Üí global

‚úÖ Common Interview Question
üß† Q: What happens when a function is invoked in JS?
‚úÖ A: A new Function Execution Context is created with its own lexical environment and a reference to the outer environment.

---*/

/*---
difference between global, function and eval execution context
üî∑ 1. Global Execution Context (GEC)
‚úÖ What is it?
The default execution context created when your JavaScript code first runs.

It represents the global scope, where top-level code (not inside any function) is executed.

‚úÖ What it contains:
A global object:

In browsers ‚Üí window

In Node.js ‚Üí global

A reference to this (points to global object in non-strict mode)

All global variables and function declarations

‚úÖ Creation:
Happens only once, at the start of program execution.
---*/

// ‚úÖ Example:
var x = 10;
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

//   Here, both x and greet are part of the Global Execution Context.

/*---
üî∑ 2. Function Execution Context (FEC)
‚úÖ What is it?
Created every time a function is invoked.

Each function call gets its own execution context.

‚úÖ Contains:
Its own variable environment (local variables, parameters)

A reference to its outer (lexical) environment

A reference to this (depends on how the function is called)

‚úÖ Lifecycle:
Just like GEC, it has:

Creation phase:

Parameters and var declarations are hoisted

let and const enter TDZ

Execution phase:

Code runs line-by-line
---*/

// ‚úÖ Example:

function outer(a) {
  var b = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a + b);
  }
  inner();
}
outer(5);

//   outer(5) creates a new FEC

// inner() also creates a new FEC, nested inside outer

/*---
üî∑ 3. Eval Execution Context (Rarely Used)
‚úÖ What is it?
Created when the eval() function is used to run a string of JavaScript code at runtime.
---*/

eval("var x = 5;");
console.log(x); // 5

/*---
‚ö†Ô∏è Why is it rarely used?
Performance cost: Slower due to dynamic code execution

Security risk: Can run untrusted code

Debugging difficulty: Hard to trace and maintain

‚úÖ Behavior:
Code inside eval() is executed in the current lexical scope, which could be global or function.

üí° Best practice: Avoid eval() unless absolutely necessary.
